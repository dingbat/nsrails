/**
 
 `NSRRemoteObject` is the primary class in NSRails - any classes that subclass it will be treated with a "remote correspondance" and ActiveResource-like APIs will be available.
  
 Note that you do not have to define an `id` property for your Objective-C class, as your subclass will inherit NSRRemoteObject's `remoteID` property.
  
 # CoreData
 
 To use NSRails with CoreData, subclass <NSRRemoteManagedObject>.
 
 # Validation Errors
 
 If a create or update failed due to validation reasons, NSRails will package the validation failures into a dictionary. This can be retrieved using the key constant `NSRValidationErrorsKey` in the `userInfo` property of the error. This dictionary contains **each failed property as a key**, with each respective object being **an array of the reasons that property failed validation**. For instance,
 
	 NSError *error;
	 if (![user createRemote:&error])
	 {
		 NSDictionary *validationErrors = [[error userInfo] objectForKey:NSRValidationErrorsKey];
		 
		 for (NSString *property in validationErrors)
		 {
			 for (NSString *reasonForFailure in [validationErrors objectForKey:property])
			 {
				 NSLog(@"%@ %@",property,reasonForFailure);  //=> "Name can't be blank"
			 }
		 }
	 }
 
 # Overriding Behavior
 
 See the "Methods to Override" section of this class reference. These methods can be overriden for custom per-property behavior.
 
 Remember, **these are not delegate methods**. You **must** make a call to `super` if you're not overriding behavior for that property.
 
 Finally, check out the [NSRails Cookbook](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/Cookbook) for quick overriding recipes.

/**
 Should be overridden if instances of your subclass class should have their resource path be based off an association.
 
 This may be needed if you define your routes in Rails to look something like:
 
     MySweetApp::Application.routes.draw do
       resources :users
         resources :invites
       end
     end
 
 Typically, this method is overriden with an instance variable that represents a parent:
 
     @implementation Invite
     @synthesize user, foo;
 
     - (NSRRemoteObject *) objectUsedToPrefixRequest:(NSRRequest *)request
     {
         return user;
     }

 Now, invites will be accessed in relation to the given user (assume its `remoteID` is 1):
 
     GET    /users/1/invites.json
     POST   /users/1/invites.json
     GET    /users/1/invites/3.json
     DELETE /users/1/invites/3.json

 Note that if `user`'s `<remoteID>` is `nil`, an exception will be thrown (its ID is needed in constructing the route). 
 
 You may also filter requests that you don't want to prefix using the **request** parameter. Let's say you only want this behavior for POST and GET, but want to keep DELETE and PATCH with their traditional routes:
 
     GET    /users/3/invites.json  "get all the invites for user 3"
     POST   /users/3/invites.json  "create an invite for user 3"
     PATCH  /invites/28.json       "update user invite 28"
     DELETE /invites/28.json       "delete user invite 28"
 
 This could be done by checking **request**'s [httpMethod](NSRRequest.html#//api/name/httpMethod):
 
     - (NSRRemoteObject *) objectUsedToPrefixRequest:(NSRRequest *)request
     {
         if ([request.httpMethod isEqualToString:@"GET"] || [request.httpMethod isEqualToString:@"POST"])

     }

/**
 Should return the remote representation for each property, optionally modifying the remote key.
 
 This method should be overridden if you have a property whose JSON representation should be different than its actual object value when sending and retrieving to/from Rails.
 
     @interface MyClass : NSRRemoteObject
     
     @property (nonatomic, strong) NSURL *URL;         //on the server this is a plain string
     @property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray *csvArray;  //on the server this is a comma-separated string
     
     @end
 
 In the example above, we can't send these objects to a server as-is, since the server expects strings for both of these. We want to send `URL` as its actual content (remember, NSURL is not JSON-encodable), and send the array `csvArray` as a plain, comma-separated string. Here's a possible overridden implementation:
 
     @implementation MyClass
     
     - (id) encodeValueForProperty:(NSString *)property remoteKey:(NSString **)remoteKey
     {
         if ([property isEqualToString:@"csvArray"])
             return [csvArray componentsJoinedByString:@","];
         
         if ([property isEqualToString:@"URL"])
             return [URL absoluteString];
         
         return [super encodeValueForProperty:property remoteKey:remoteKey];
     }
 
     @end

 Note: the default implementation of this method will automatically take care of NSDates for you, encoding them into a date format string that's Rails-friendly. The format used can be changed in [this](NSRConfig.html#//api/name/dateFormat) NSRConfig property.
 
 Overriding this method can also be used to define remote-only properties (ie, if your Rails server expects an attribute that you don’t want defined in your Objective-C class). Note here that `uniqueDeviceID` isn’t even a property of the Person class:
 
     @implementation Person
     @synthesize name, age;
     
     - (id) encodeValueForProperty:(NSString *)property remoteKey:(NSString **)remoteKey
     {
         if ([property isEqualToString:@"uniqueDeviceID"])
             return [[UIDevice currentDevice] uniqueIdentifier];
     
         return [super encodeValueForProperty:property remoteKey:remoteKey];
     }
     
     @end

 Moreover, custom remote keys can be defined here, if your Objective-C property and remote attribute differ. Simply set the contents of the *remoteKey* reference:
 
     - (id) encodeValueForProperty:(NSString *)property remoteKey:(NSString **)remoteKey
     {
         if ([property isEqualToString:@"objcProperty"])
             *remoteKey = @"railsProperty";
         
         return [super encodeValueForProperty:property remoteKey:remoteKey];
     }

 
 @param property Name of the property.
 @param remoteKey Reference to an NSString that contains the key that should be put into the JSON going out. Will contain the key that would be sent by default (ie, underscored, if [enabled](NSRConfig.html#//api/name/autoinflectsPropertyNames)).
 
 @return Remote representation for this property. Return value must be JSON-parsable (NSDictionary, NSArray, NSString, NSNumber, or (NSNull or nil)).
 
 @warning Make sure you make a call to super if a certain property shouldn't be custom-coded.
 */

 Note: the default implementation of this method will automatically take care of NSDates for you, decoding them into an NSDate object using the Rails date format. The format used can be changed in [this](NSRConfig.html#//api/name/dateFormat) NSRConfig property.
 
 Example implementing change detection:

     - (void) decodeValue:(id)remoteObject forRemoteKey:(NSString *)remoteKey change:(BOOL *)change
     {
         if ([forRemoteKey isEqualToString:@"csv_array"])
         {
            NSArray *array = [remoteObject componentsSeparatedByString:@","];
            *change = [array isEqualToArray:self.csvArray];
            self.csvArray = array;
         }
         else if ([forRemoteKey isEqualToString:@"url"])
         {
            *change = [[self.URL absoluteString] isEqualToString:remoteObject];
            self.URL = [NSURL URLWithString:remoteObject];
         }
         else
            [super decodeValue:remoteObject forRemoteKey:remoteKey change:change];
     }

 
 @param remoteObject Remote representation of this key. Will be a JSON-parsed object (NSDictionary, NSArray, NSString, NSNumber, or nil).
 @param remoteKey The remote key returned from Rails. Use `<propertyForRemoteKey:>` if you want the Objective-C property version of this key.
 @param change Reference to a change boolean. Its value should be set on a custom-coded property based off if the decoding will introduce a change in the instance variable. This is used to set the change value in `<remoteFetch:changes:>` and `<setPropertiesUsingRemoteDictionary:>.
  
 @warning Make sure you make a call to super if a certain property shouldn't be custom-coded.

- (void) decodeRemoteValue:(id)remoteObject forRemoteKey:(NSString *)remoteKey change:(BOOL *)change;

/** 
 Should return whether or not a certain property should be sent in the outgoing dictionary.
 
 Default behavior is to **not** send if:
 
 - Property is `<remoteID>` and it is `nil`, or, `nested` is false. (Sending `id` is only relevant to ensure nested objects are not re-created.)
 - Property is not a timestamp (`created at`, `updated at`).
 - Property is a relationship, would send the full `_attributes`, and `nested` is true (ie, only send "shallow" copies of objects when they are being nested. This is to prevent infinite loops when recursively sending nested properties that could also include this object).
 - Property is a relationship, but the value of the property is either `nil` or an empty collection. (No reason to send empty `_attributes`).
 
 Otherwise the property is sent. So typically, this method is overridden if you do not wish to have a property in an outgoing dictionary. Overriding this method would look like this:
 
     - (BOOL) shouldSendProperty:(NSString *)property whenNested:(BOOL)nested
     {
        //never send retrieveOnlyProperty to your server
        if ([property isEqualToString:@"retrieveOnlyProperty"])
            return NO;
 
        //deepNest is a property with a has-one/has-many relationship that would otherwise not be sent when this object is nested
        if ([property isEqualToString:@"deepNest"] && nested)
            return YES;
     
        return [super shouldSendProperty:property whenNested:nested];
     }
 
 The "shouldSetProperty" equivalent is done through `<decodeRemoteValue:forRemoteKey:change:>`. Simply override it and do nothing for that property if you do not want to decode it.
 
 @param property The name of the property.
 @param nested Whether or not the receiving object is being nested.
 @return YES if the property should be included in the dictionary, NO if it shouldn't.
 
 @warning Make sure you make a call to super if a certain property shouldn't be manually managed.
 */
- (BOOL) shouldSendProperty:(NSString *)property whenNested:(BOOL)nested;

/**
 Should return the class for the nested object stored in the property, or nil if it is not a nested object.
 
 The default behavior is to simply return the *type* of the property if it is a subclass of NSRRemoteObject. Otherwise, returns `nil`.
 
 This must be overriden for any to-many relationships (since the property type is just an array, and NSRails doesn't know what kind of object should be stored).
 
     - (Class) nestedClassForProperty:(NSString *)property
     {
         if ([property isEqualToString:@"responses"])
             return [Response class];

 **Ruby**:
 
     def nestedClassForProperty(property)
       return Response if property == "responses"
       return Author if property == "author"
     end
 
 Because Ruby is not statically typed, this must be overriden for all relationships -  NSRails can't "guess" what class you want to nest in a property.
 
 @param property Name of the property.
 @return The class for the nested object stored in the property, or nil if it is not a nested object.
 
 @warning In Objective-C, make sure you make a call to super.

/**
 Should return whether or not a nested object should be sent with its entire body (`<x>_attributes`), or just ID (`<x>_id`).
 
 The default behavior is to return `NO`. (You don't have to make a call to super here.)
 
 This is useful if you have a property whose relationship is "belongs to". Meaning, the receiving object on the server holds the foreign key - it has, say, a `parent_id`, which you want sent instead of `parent_attributes` (which would anger Rails).
 
     - (BOOL) shouldOnlySendIDKeyForNestedObjectProperty:(NSString *)property
     {
        return [property isEqualToString:"group"];
     }
 
 @param property Name of the property.
 @return YES if only the `<x>_id` key should be sent for this nested property, NO if the full `<x>_attributes` should be sent.

- (BOOL) shouldOnlySendIDKeyForNestedObjectProperty:(NSString *)property;

/**
 Should return the equivalent Objective-C property for a given remote key.
 
 For example, will return `updatedAt` (the Objective-C property) for the `updated_at` key in an incoming dictionary, assuming that your class defines an `updatedAt` property.
 
 The default behavior is to autoinflect into camelCase (if [enabled](NSRConfig.html#//api/name/autoinflectsPropertyNames)), or convert `id` to `remoteID`. If the resulting conversino is not found as a property in the class, returns `nil`.
 
 Overriding example:
 
     - (NSString *) propertyForRemoteKey:(NSString *)remoteKey
     {
         //the "rails" key given from a Rails hash will be translated to the "objc" property when decoding
         if ([remoteKey isEqualToString:@"rails"])
             return @"objc";
         
         return [super propertyForRemoteKey:remoteKey];
     }

 It is possible to also override decodeRemoteValue:forRemoteKey:changes: and setting the `objc` property manually for a remoteKey of "rails", but since `<decodeRemoteValue:forRemoteKey:changes:>` uses this method internally, it is cleaner to just override this method.

 The inverse method remoteKeyForProperty does not exist - instead override `<encodeValueForProperty:remoteKey:>` and modify the remote key.
 
 @param remoteKey The key sent in the remote dictionary.
 @return The Objective-C property equivalent for a remote key. If your class doesn't define a property for this remote key, this should return `nil`.

/**
 Should return an array of all properties to be used by NSRails.
 
 Default behavior is to introspect into the class and return an array of all non-primitive type properties. This also escalates up the class hierarchy to NSRRemoteObject's properties as well (ie, `remoteID`).
 
 If you want to override this, you should add or remove objects from super:
 
     - (NSMutableArray *) remoteProperties
     {
         NSMutableArray *props = [super remoteProperties];
         
         //remove an object from NSRails entirely
         [props removeObject:@"totallyLocal"];
         
         //can even add a property not defined in your class - encodable in encodeValueForProperty:remoteKey:
         [props addObject:@"totallyRemote"];
         
         return props;
     }
 
 **Ruby**:
 
 Overriding this method, adding on all of your instance variables is necessary in RubyMotion because properties are created on runtime and Objective-C introspection won't apply.
 
     def remoteProperties
       super + ["author", "content", "created_at"]
