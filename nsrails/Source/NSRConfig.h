/**
 
 The NSRails configuration class is `NSRConfig`, a class that stores your Rails app's configuration settings (server URL, etc) for either your app globally or in specific instances. It also supports basic HTTP authentication and can be subclassed to fit specific implementations.
 
 ## Universal Config
 
 This should meet the needs of the vast majority of Rails apps. Somewhere in your app setup, set your server URL (and optionally a username and password) using the `defaultConfig` singleton:

	//AppDelegate.m

	#import "NSRConfig.h"

	- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
	{
	 [[NSRConfig defaultConfig] setAppURL:@"http://myapp.com"];
	 
	 //Similarly, if using HTTP Authentication, you can set your app's username and password like this:
	 //[[NSRConfig defaultConfig] setAppUsername:@"username"];
	 //[[NSRConfig defaultConfig] setAppPassword:@"password"];
	 ...
	}
 
 ## Config environments
 
 `NSRConfig` supports several environments if you have a test and production server and don't want to switch between the two all the time. The constants `NSRConfigEnvironmentDevelopment` and `NSRConfigEnvironmentProduction` can be used, but any string will do.
 
	NSRConfig *devConfig = [[NSRConfig alloc] initWithAppURL:@"http://localhost:3000"];
	[devConfig useAsDefaultForEnvironment:NSRConfigEnvironmentDevelopment];
	
	NSRConfig *prodConfig = [[NSRConfig alloc] initWithAppURL:@"http://myapp.com"];
	prodConfig.appUsername = @"username";
	prodConfig.appPassword = @"password";
	[prodConfig useAsDefaultForEnvironment:NSRConfigEnvironmentProduction];
	 
	// Now set your environment for the rest of the app... (set to Development by default so this isn't even necessary)
	[NSRConfig setCurrentEnvironment:NSRConfigEnvironmentDevelopment];
	// And the relevant config will be used in future calls to "defaultConfig" or in any "remote<X>" methods.
 
 The environment in which a config exists (production, development, or your own) has no bearing on its behavior in sending/receiving from your server.
 
 ## Using several configs in one project
 
 - If you simply need to direct different objects to different URLs, use the useForClass: method. Base URLs, autoinflection, date formats, and any other NSRConfig configurations will be used for NSRails actions called on this class or its instances:
 
		NSRConfig *peopleServer = [[NSRConfig alloc] initWithAppURL:@"http://secondrailsapp.com"];
		[peopleServer useForClass:[Person class]];

 - If specific actions must be called using a separate config, an `NSRConfig` instance can be used to define a context block in which to call those config-specific methods:
		
		NSRConfig *myConfig = [[NSRConfig alloc] initWithAppURL:@"http://secondrailsapp.com/"];
		
		[myConfig use];
		NSArray *peopleFromOtherServer = [Person getAllRemote];
		[myConfig end];
 
	Or, using block notation:
 
		NSArray *peopleToTransfer = [Person getAllRemote];
		NSRConfig *myConfig = [[NSRConfig alloc] initWithAppURL:@"http://secondrailsapp.com/"];
		[myConfig useIn:^
			{
				for (Person *p in peopleToTransfer)
				{
					[p remoteCreate];
				}
			}
		];
 
	In these examples, everything within the blocks will be called using the config context specified, regardless of `defaultConfig` or any class-specific config (they take highest precedence).
 
	You can nest several config contexts within each other.
 
 ## Config precedence
 
 When an NSRails method is called, NSRails uses the following hierarchy to find an NSRConfig to use:
 
 - **"Override" config:** If use was called (explicitly or implicity via a block). If they are nested, whichever one is on top of the stack (latest one).
 - **Instance-specific config**: If the method is an instance method and the instance was initialized with initWithCustomMap:customConfig:, will use that config.
 - **Class-specific config**: If the receiving class of the method (class or instance) defines a custom class with useForClass:.
 - **Default config**: (Most frequent case.) Uses the config set to default of the current environment. (Current environment is `NSRConfigEnvironmentDevelopment` by default.
 

 ## Subclassing NSRConfig
 
 Subclassing NSRConfig can be useful if you want to implement a connection method that's not HTTP (for example, HTTPS), or if you're using a non-Rails REST service with different standards. Moreover, it can be used to generate errors specific to your app.
 
 - The main method to override if you wish to do so is responseForRequestType:requestBody:url:sync:orAsync:. This method is called internally by NSRails and expects a Foundation objects that correspond to the returned JSON (ie, NSArray, NSDictionary).
 
 - This should also set the `NSError **error` or perform the `NSRHTTPCompletionBlock completionBlock`, whichever one is present.
	- In determining errors, it is highly recommend to use the helper method errorForResponse:statusCode:. This method will return you any Rails-specific errors (like validation errors), as well as make the error message succinct. In addition to being used, it is also possible to override this method (making sure to check if a `super` call to it returns anything) if your Rails app has specific errors you want to handle.
 
 - You can set your new `NSRConfig` subclass to be the default config like so (this would be instead of the first code example of course):
 
		CustomConfig *myConfig = [[CustomConfig alloc] initWithAppURL:@"https://localhost:3000"];
		//set custom myConfig properties...
 
		[myConfig useAsDefault];
 
		//or, to a specific environment:
		[myConfig useAsDefaultForEnvironment:NSRConfigEnvironmentProduction];
 
	Or, if only a _certain_ action requires it, you can use your new instance for a block of code just as you would in the section above.
