h2. NSRails

Welcome! NSRails is a light-weight Objective-C library to make interfacing with a Rails back-end easy.


h3. +What can NSRails do?+

NSRails builds ActiveResource support straight into your iOS models, meaning CRUD operations and others can be called seamlessly via Objective-C methods.
This library is simple but flexible, meaning that it'll fit the various needs of your Rails project:
* Define only certain attributes to be shared with Rails
* Have different property and/or model names between Rails and iOS
* Nested models
* Basic HTTP authentication
* Asynchronous requests


h3. +How do I get started?+

Stick the source folder into your Xcode project (making sure to copy files), and:
* Subclass RailsModel
* List the properties you want to share with Rails using the RailsShare macro
* Create, get, destroy, and update your models in one line!

For more details:
* See the Wiki
* See the included troubleshooting file if you run into any errors
* Documentation soon to come (promise)


h3. +What's in the sources?+

The main class in NSRails and the one to inherit from is RailsModel (defined in NSRails.h). Also included are a mainly-static NSRConfig class for app settings and an NSRConnection class used internally.
NSRails also makes use of the Objective-C JSON framework and steals ObjectiveResource's NSString InflectionSupport category. ObjectiveResource was largely the inspiration for NSRails, and it was sad to see it drop support. Thanks guys!
